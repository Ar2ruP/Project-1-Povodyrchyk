    <string name="about_anima">Together, we organize camps called \"Fun Holidays with God\" and various other camps. We
        participate in organizing walking pilgrimages and celebrations at the parish. We discover new acting talents by
        participating in plays. We develop comprehensively through clubs and other activities, which we have the
        opportunity to conduct to glorify God. Of course, we also enrich ourselves spiritually together with our
        spiritual guide, Father Mykita Ovchar, OSBM. \"Animators are one soul and one heart. Always remember, for Whom
        it beats!\"
